,,,,,,"My feedback:
Students are getting unsatisfied when we change the teacher with each module. There should be one teacher who teaches the whole course.
Students are more satisfied with the classes of sir Raheel. They are unable to understand Aman Mohsin.
There are many technical issues such as not getting the recorded lectures on time, unable to attend the classes on loom or app. 
Students are asking about a proper curriculum that is provided at the start of the course to make it better understandabe about all the modules.
Students are experiencing unprofessionalism as the teacher does not have a good internet connection that results in the class management issue.
Students reported that the course content is merged alot as the teacher/management don't have enough time to complete it in a relax mode.
The things should be more expanded in order to uderstandable to the students. 
Students who are not from the background of prgramming are unable to understand React js in the first class. There should be basics first like HTML, CSS, Javascript.
Portal issue should be resolved as they are having so much technical issue in that.",,,,,,
